# Progress Tracker

## Multi-Agent Coordination Rules
- Before starting a service: check "In Progress" — if it's already claimed, pick another
- When claiming: add `- <service-name> [CLAIMED by <agent-worktree/branch>]` to In Progress immediately
- When done: move to Completed with a one-line summary
- Services with unmet dependencies (see below) must wait — do not start them early

## Completed Services
- auth-service – JWT auth, OAuth (Google, LinkedIn), session management
- user-service – talent profile, certifications, education, experience, industries, languages, skills
- listings-service – projects, services, jobs, teams, media
- checkout-service – Stripe checkout, wallet, webhooks
- messaging-service – Ably real-time, message threads, history
- notification-service – Ably push, SendGrid email, event handlers, preferences

## In Progress
